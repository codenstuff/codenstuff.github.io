After much deliberation about how I would go about creating a blog, I decided to just go for it. I had previously deliberated about using DigitalOcean to host my site and spinning up a Wordpress install, but decided that wasn't necessary for my purposes.
I had read about Github Pages a while ago and figured I would give it a shot as I only need to host a simple blog with static content. That eventually brought me to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is what I will now be using to generate my blog.

One plus with Jekyll is that I can author posts in Markdown, which is what I used to use to take notes in class. I was able to get this all setup and running with my custom domain name and an SSL certificate super easy. I'm really looking forward to see
where this blog takes me.
