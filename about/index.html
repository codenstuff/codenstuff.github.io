title: Who is Jesse Goebel?

<h1>Who is Jesse Goebel?</h1>
<p>That's a fair enough question. I think at my core, I am someone whose brain never stops. I've always found it difficult to focus in on one thing and stick with it. This means that generally, I feel more at peace when I am inundated with tasks and projects. That's not to say I will ever finish any of it. I've had my guitar for years and am still quite mediocre.
But I mean to say that I hate being bored. There is nothing worse for me than sitting idle. So how did I get here?</p>
<p>Well, I went to university for Computer Science in 2012 and graduated end of 2016. I barely graduated as I struggled a lot in my upper level courses, but nevertheless, I made it through. I think my biggest road block with programming has always been my lack of ideas and inspiration. 
Without having something to be passionate about building, I had less motivation to learn the more complex topics introduced in my upper levels. Now that I have graduated, I have been working in the field of governance, risk, and compliance for medical devices.
It wasn't what I went to school for and I think that's exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>Having a new field of information to learn was a huge motivating factor for me and I'm very proud of the work I've done over the last few years. Now that I feel like I've settled into a professional career, it feels more natural to go back and explore programming for my own enjoyment. Coming from a background with C++ and Java, I thought that I would try a different
approach this time, as I don't need the control offered by C++ or the robustness of Java. I can see that everything is shifting towards web applications, so Python and JavaScript seem to be much more suitable to my current needs. I am now currently working on learning Python by going through Learn Python the Hard Way
and Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. I've got the JavaScript and JQuery book by Jon Duckett on the backburner as well for once I feel more comfortable with Python.</p>
<p>This site is pretty much just going to be where I blog about what I'm currently doing with programming and may also overlap a bit with my security background as I work on my SSCP certification.</p>
